# How to customize appearance of a chart


<p>This example demonstrates how to customize a chart's appearance at runtime. The <strong>AppearanceName</strong> property allows you to set one of the predefined appearances to a chart, each determining the chart's overall look including its background, diagram, axis, series and text colors.</p><p>Moreover, it is possible to adjust a chart's palette, which determines the look of the chart's series in greater detail. This can be done by customizing the <strong>PaletteName</strong> property. Furthermore, for each palette you can define its base color, by using the <strong>PaletteBaseColorNumber</strong> property.</p>
